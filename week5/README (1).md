# Review and Discussion of research papers / applications
This week is about getting some familiarity with the range of applications possible with deep feed-forward architectures.

## Colouring in of gray-scale images
`(Tuesday: led by Scott, and ...)`
* this is an application
* Colouring in of gray-scale images - see the links for this in ["inspirational applications of deep learning"](http://machinelearningmastery.com/inspirational-applications-deep-learning/)
** [colorization](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~larsson/colorization/)
* Some after thoughts on image colourization - https://www.scribd.com/document/320624109/Image-Colouring-Theory


## deep reinforcement learning
`(Wednesday: led by Luke Inkster and Kelsey Jack)`
* For a good place to start, read the [Karpathy summary and discussion](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
* That algorithm combines a deep net and regular policy gradient ideas, on a new application.`
* [AlphaGo](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html) uses both a policy net and a value prediction.

## Reinforcement learning with Value Functions
Instead of discussing a research paper, this was a "regular lecture". We got about half-way through it, so will continue next Tuesday with this.
* [RL with Values](https://github.com/garibaldu/comp421/blob/master/week5/lecture_RL_via_Values.pdf)
* See also: [notebook demonstration of Value Iteration](https://github.com/garibaldu/comp421/blob/master/notebooks/demo_value_iteration.ipynb)

`(I decided to postpone the discussion of Generative Adversarial Nets until later in the course:
probablhy to be led by Yi Liu and Linfeng Gu, 2014 paper by Goodfellow et al. that has already been cited 150 times [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), and perhaps [this](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/gan/) useful.
)`
