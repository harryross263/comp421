# Assessment structure:
   * 5 for each of two presentations
   * 10 for each of three assignments
   * 20 for a project (and short interview on it)
   * 40 for a 2 hour exam
 
# Contribute!

__Pull requests__ Add some notes of what you lecture up here, scribbles/notes of related problems, add links to resources, ... ?

__Raise an issue.__ Ask questions, clarify course matrial, ... ?? Just treat it like a forum.

These will be the notes and resources the exams and assignments are built from. It should (hopefully) serve as good study material.
